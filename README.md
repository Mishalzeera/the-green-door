Rea Mac has been cutting men's hair for over 25 years specializing in 50’s and 40’s hairstyles . She opened her first shop Called Eddy’s Deluxe 2001 in Sacramento California. Paving the way for the hipster barber shops that would pop up some years later.Rea has alway welcomed the oddballs and misfits from her community to share her space. Not much has changed from that shop to this shop, that is, she is still welcoming local artists to show and sell their art and wares in her shop space. Rea and Rob of Mad Daddy’s Barbershop are hosting community based and cultural gatherings, working with local artists and musicians to make life more fun.
